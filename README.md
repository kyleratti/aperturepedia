A guide to first-party vintage SLR lenses. View it live at [https://aperturepedia.com](https://aperturepedia.com)

With the increased interest in vintage lenses due to their easy adaptability with modern mirrorless cameras, [Aperturepedia](https://aperturepedia.com) is designed to serve as a central hub for data on vintage camera lenses.

## Criteria for lens inclusion:
1. Lens must designed for full-frame film SLR cameras. _(rangefinder & medium format lenses may be added after 35mm lens data is complete)_
2. Lenses must be manufactured or branded by the camera manufacturer (Minolta, Nikon, etc). No 3rd party lenses for now.
3. Only manual focus lenses will be included for now due to their greater adaptability to modern mirrorless cameras.
4. Lenses must have been made in the 20th century (aka "vintage").
5. Lens systems are generally prioritized by popularity and availability of reference data.
